# PICTURE-C Temperature Controller on I2C Bus

>>>> Begin

Hi Sunip, 
I found something for you to do. 

We have these temperature & humidity sensors:

This is the actual sensor chip from TI:

I left one on your desk. Can you figure out how to use it? 
It uses an I2C interface. Kuravi said we have a raspberry pi that has I2C. Could you please wire it up and write a test program in C to read it out? 

Thanks, 
Chris
